# Currently only supports learning Japanese as an English speaker
# This project was started entirely for personal use! It was made as quickly as possible to be functional.

# Before running:
#  - Install Japanese language to windows!
#    - win -> language settings -> Add a language -> Japanese
#  - Change shift key to disable caps lock (often gets stuck on by accident)
#    - win -> advanced keyboard settings -> Input language hot keys -> (to turn off Caps Lock) Press the SHIFT key

# There's likely some requirements missing + dictionary missing + etc...

# Info on converting epub->txt : /LN/convert_info.md

# (UI TODO:) If it seems to be taking a long time to launch, it's likely in the process of downloading news files from NHK (check output).
